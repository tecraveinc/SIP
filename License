2. License Grants 

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this EULA: 

a. Subject to the restrictions set forth below, this EULA grants you a non-exclusive, perpetual license to install and use one (1) copy of the specific Edition of the Software accompanying this EULA, in object code format, on only one computer that is owned or controlled by you, and solely for your own internal business purposes or in connection with providing web-based or hosted telephony services and other telecommunication services to third parties.  The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer.  The license granted hereunder shall not be effective until you have paid in full all license fees, as applicable, for the Software due and payable to Brekeke, and meet all other requirements set forth in this EULA.

b. You may transfer the Software to a different computer subject to the transfer procedure and policy set forth in Brekeke's License Transfer Policy, provided that you discontinue use of and destroy all copies of the Software from the computer where it was originally installed. License transfer is available for Commercial License only. Brekeke reserves the right to change or update any part of the License Transfer Policy from time to time without prior notice.  The latest and most current License Transfer Policy can be found on Brekeke's website at http://www.brekeke.com/buy/buy_lic-transfer_policy.php. 

c. You may create a backup copy of the Software's binary for your own personal safekeeping only. You may not install or activate more than one copy of the Software at any time. You may not distribute, resell or share, the Software or any portions of the Software.

d. You may not use multiple instances of the Software in virtual environments without obtaining and paying for a separate license of each such use of the Software.

e. You agree that Brekeke may audit your use of the Software for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the event that such audit reveals any use of the Software by you other than in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, you shall reimburse Brekeke for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such non-compliance. 

f. Your license rights under this EULA are non-exclusive. 

g. There may be technological measures in this Software that are designed to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of the Software. You agree that Brekeke may use these measures to protect Brekeke against software piracy. The Software may contain enforcement technology that limits the ability to install and activate the Software on a computer to not more than a finite number of times for a finite number of computers. The Software contains enforcement technology that may require activation as further set forth on the Brekeke website, and which may mean that the Software will only operate for a finite period of time after the Software's activation by You. You may also need to reactivate the Software if you modify your computer hardware, alter the Software, or install the Software on another computer. Product activation is based on the exchange of information between your computer and Brekeke. Since the licenses are user-specific, the nature of the activation process means personally identifiable information IS transmitted during such activations, and is logged for purposes of debugging and security. 

h. You acknowledge and agree that the technological measures employed by Brekeke to detect unlicensed or illegal use of the Software may not always work as intended.  If you believe that your use of the Software has been restricted without a proper reason, you agree to promptly notify Brekeke and follow all instructions provided by Brekeke to resolve that issue. 

i. The licenses to the Academic Edition are subject to Brekeke's express approval after reviewing your request. Brekeke reserves the right to reject any request for issuance of an Academic Edition license.
